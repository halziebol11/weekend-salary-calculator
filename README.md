# Salary Calculator

## Description

This web app receives form data (employee first and last name, ID number, job title and annual salary) and displays it in a table. The total monthly cost of the employees' salaries is displayed and the display area turns red if the total exceeds $20,000.

Employees can be removed from the table and the total will update accordingly.
